# Vinci-Index
The files can be used to calculate the Vinci-index introduces in the manuscript.
There is an Excel file for the calculation of the Vinci-index for various n, this also allows for the check of the axioms of scale and population invariance.
A limitation of Excel is that the function ARCTAN2 is not defined if both arguments equal zero.
The Jupyter-Notebooks demonstrate transfer sensitivity, the diminishing transfer principle and weak decomposability for the new index.
