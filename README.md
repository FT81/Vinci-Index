I provide files that can be used to calculate and analyze the Vinci index introduces in the manuscript "A new inequality measurement tool: The Vinci index".
The Vinci index for various numbers of observations can be calculated with the Excel file,
it's also possible to check the axioms of scale and population invariance with it.
A limitation of Microsoft Excel is that the function ARCTAN2 is not defined if both arguments equal zero, most other implementations of the function don't have this limitation.
The Jupyter-Notebooks demonstrate other properties like transfer sensitivity, the diminishing transfer principle, and weak decomposability for the new index.
